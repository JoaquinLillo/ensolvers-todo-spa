### Hi Ensolvers! :wave:

I am very happy to have developed this application during these 3 days.
I have learned a lot since I sped up my React learning.
Hope you like!

<summary>Considerations:</summary>

- If some tasks doesn't delete, just refresh the page.

This is an easy bug to fix, but I'm new to React. In all my experience, I have worked with traditional MVC Spring pages and this architecture is something I was unaware of a week ago.

### How to run it?

To run the application, you must first run on the console ```script.sh ```

Then, if everything went okay:
- The frontend app will be running on your localhost port: **3000**
- The backend app will be running on your localhost port: **8080**

<summary>Posible exceptions:</summary>

1. In case that maven throws an exception like: *this enviroments has no compiler* you will have to create an environment variable like this:

-set JAVA_HOME: (here paste your jdk path)
